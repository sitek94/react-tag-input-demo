## Patched Packages

- `react-tag-input` - I opened an issue [#840](https://github.com/react-tags/react-tags/issues/840) to extend
  class names that can be used to style `<ul>` and `<li>` elements within suggestions wrapper, 
  but until it's resolved and eventually released I'm using a patched version
- `@types/react-tag-input` - Also, patched the types, so that TypeScript is not yelling at me ðŸ™Š
